# Shopping Cart
A classic shopping cart application in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
List items are rendered from a collection to display our shop.
Shop items each have a quantity field and an add button for adding elements into the cart Array.

This exercise demonstrates: 
* the ability to render list items to and from collections
* add event listeners to our buttons and input fields
* a search algorithm using a boolean flag for updating cart elements
